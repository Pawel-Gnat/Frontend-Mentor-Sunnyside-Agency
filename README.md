## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:

I created consts to toggle menu and active classes on hamburger menu button click event.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I did this challenge in 18 hours. I learned the difference between image and background-image. I learned about :not() property in CSS. I learned how to animate my hamburger button with JavaScript and how to change navigation bar from mobile to desktop view. It might be better done, but I think I should move further to next challenges.

I used BEM methodoloy and SCSS.
